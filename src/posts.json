This event showcased the unique features and benefits of their innovations within the automated warehouse sector. Over 30 attendees received an exclusive look at URBX’s groundbreaking technology, including the new GridBot, TowerBot, and conveyor system, demonstrated within a compact 10-foot racking system. This DEMO represents a significant milestone for URBX, highlighting the company&apos;s commitment to delivering a revolutionary system designed to enhance efficiency and transform warehouse operations.</p></div><div><h4>Key Components</h4><p>The DEMO featured an advanced system incorporating the latest GridBot, two TowerBots, and a conveyor system, all engineered for optimal performance. The system demonstrated at the event was designed for efficient operation with two TowerBots and one GridBot. On the left side of the setup, a conveyor mechanism was utilized, where one TowerBot retrieved multiple totes from storage and transported them to the conveyor system for further processing. On the right side, the racking system included a GridBot interacting with a separate TowerBot. In this configuration, the TowerBot collected multiple totes from storage and delivered them to a designated buffer zone. From there, the GridBot handled the totes, ensuring precise and efficient picking operations. The DEMO effectively showcased the system&apos;s capability to store and retrieve numerous totes within a multi-level racking system at high speeds, all through a fully automated process. This event marked a significant milestone, highlighting the advancements of the URBX system to a select group of attendees and underscoring the notable progress and growth achieved by URBX.</p></div>"
